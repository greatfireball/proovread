Revision history for Perl extension String::Similarity

1.04 Fri Jul  3 15:48:09 CEST 2009
	- work around atrocious bugs in activestate windows, which pollutes
          the namespace with nonstandard symbols, equalling only the bush junta
          in brokenness.

1.03 Mon Jun 11 23:15:35 CEST 2007
	- bump the version number, seems cpan ignored the 1.02 upload.

1.02 Mon Feb 12 16:26:08 CET 2007
	- add missing use Exporter, add use DynaLoader for symmetry and
          because I was told some bug in bleadperl might require that.
        - add 'no warnings' to testsuite. If your perl is too old, remove
          it.

1.01 Thu Mar  3 18:00:52 CET 2005
	- change of contact address.

1.0  Fri Jan 30 15:16:16 CET 2004
        - Fixed correctness in the presence of non-latin1-characters, at a
          small speed penalty. Based on an idea by Dave Evans.
        - perl 5.8.x+ required.

0.02  Thu Nov 16 01:30:16 CET 2000
	- added minimum_similarity limit to speed up some searches
        - last version to work with perls <5.8.x.
